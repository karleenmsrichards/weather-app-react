**CHALLENGES:**

1. I faced a dilema with one of the endpoints of my weather app. There was no explaination as to why the app was unable to retrieve weather forecasts for more than 2 days. My initial intention was to provide a 7-Day weather forecast but I had to instead only provide 2.

2. Another challenge relates to design. I acted as UX/UI for my project as well and I faced a dilema as it relates to the color of the app. I wanted something simple but readable. I really wanted to have a white font color and it was a bit difficult finding a background that would facilitate the use of white text and be withing best standards.

**FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT**

1. Hourly forecast feature.
2. Report and issue feature.
3. Open in maps feature.

**HOW TO RUN:**
To run this project please run `npm start` in the root directory.
