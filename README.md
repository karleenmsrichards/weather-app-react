## Challenges

1. I faced a dilemma with one of the endpoints of my weather app. There was no explanation as to why the app was unable to retrieve weather forecasts for more than 2 days. My initial intention was to provide a 7-day weather forecast, but I had to settle for only 2 days.
   
2. Another challenge was related to design. I acted as the UX/UI designer for my project as well and faced a dilemma regarding the color scheme of the app. I wanted something simple but readable. I aimed for a white font color, which made finding a suitable background challenging.

## Features to Implement

1. Hourly forecast feature.
2. Report an issue feature.
3. Open in maps feature.

## How to Run
